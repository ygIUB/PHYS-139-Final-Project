# PHYS-139 Final Project: Mitochondrial Segmentation on EM Cell Images

## About
This project is an effort at extending our chosen paper on MoDL to segment mitochondria from background in Electron Microscopy Images instead of Fluorescent images. Mitochondrial segmentation allows one to further study the morphology and efficiency of the mitochondria as well. This task has been carried out by using Image Preprocessing, a 2D Convolutional Neural Network and a modified U-Net model. It has been trained and validated on a dataset from CEM-MitoLab.

## Requirements
(The specific requirements for the Model)

## Installation
(Instructions to set up environment and dependencies)

## Usage
(How to run code, scripts, or notebooks — with examples)

## Data
The Project's dataset has been referenced in the GitHub repository. It is saved in the form of a .zip file in a Google Drive. The link is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZmZ1RG796ClDXdjM_TKP6RGAd-pNKZfH/view?usp=drive_link).

A good way to procure the dataset would be to directly download it and then unzip it in the desired directory.
```unzip cem-mitolab.zip -d /extracted```
